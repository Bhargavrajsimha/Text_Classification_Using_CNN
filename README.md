# **Text Classification using CNN**

## **Objective:**

To develop a deep learning model to classify text into predefined categories.

## **Data Preprocessing:**

Handled text encoding issues and class imbalance. Tokenized and converted text into numerical representations using word embeddings.

## **Model Architecture:**

Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for text classification. Utilized embedding layers, convolutional layers, and fully connected layers.

## **Training & Optimization:**

Used cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification. Optimized model performance using Adam optimizer and dropout for regularization.

## **Model Evaluation:**

Measured accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. Visualized model performance with confusion matrix and loss curves.

## **Tech Stack:** 

Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
